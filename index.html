    <h2>Hejsa! It has been a long time since we have not seen each other, right? What about breaking this very boring habit? The 5th September 2020, from 12PM to 12AM, an intimate meeting is organised. Forgive us for keeping the location secret though but we would like to surprise you :). For this great occasion, we will welcome Karsten Pflum, a talented danish called as a sonic architect, producing very particular sounds. Around him, most of the FEUM crew will make sure to satisfy your ears.</h2>

    <h2>As you know, we are evolving in a very particular situation at the moment. Therefore, we need to make sure that current rules related to health policy are strictly followed and applied.</h2>
