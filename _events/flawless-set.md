Feum Live has returned as a collaborative effort. FEUM - Institut For (x) - Embassy Residency

What unites us is a love of electronic music. This time, we'd like to present you with two live acts from Croatia: Amor and Zuli. 

Croatian Amor and Zuli are two artists whose distinct and highly individual sounds have made significant contributions to international experimental electronic music. Both artists will stay at the Aarhus resident studio during the residency to explore the possibility of co-producing new material. The residency will conclude on Friday, March 3rd, with a performance at A-huset in Institut for x. 

FEUM will make sure to heat up the dance floor just right after. Local dj’s will spin for you techno, bass, break and experimental sounds. 

A bit more about the artists : 

【About ZULI 】

Ahmed El Ghazoly, aka ZULI, is an Egyptian multi-instrumentalist, producer, and sound artist. He is the co-founder of Kairo is Koming (KIK), a collective of six artists who were instrumental in the rise of the city's underground electronic music scene, and AHOMA, a Cairo-based collective of over 18 musicians and visual artists. ZULI co-founded Cairo's alternative music venue and club, VENT, with Asem Tag ($$$TAG$$$), from 2013 to 2015, before transforming their project into a namesake club night and festival. ZULI's debut EP, Bionic Ahmed, was released on Lee Gamble's UIQ label, and he followed it up with another playfully unconventional release, Numbers. Every second Tuesday of the month you can listen to his show on NTS Radio. [](https://www.nts.live/shows/ZULI/?fbclid=IwAR0ba9UEDGIUowGxqDL1mccdxhpr5xnha3TP14i5JzGhA9QMxwoyv5B6XYQ)

【 About Croatian Amor 】

Loke Rahbek's imprint is all over modern European electronic music. He cofounded Posh Isolation ten years ago in Copenhagen, a label and collective that emerged from the noise music scene and is now at the epicenter of Scandinavian ambient, experimental, and techno. Rahbek made stirring synth pop as part of Lust For Youth; as part of Damien Dubrovnik, it was screeching, ear-bleeding noise. This is in addition to other projects on which he has worked with artists such as Varg and Puce Mary. However, it is under the Croatian Amor alias that Rahbek has created his most immersive musical world, collapsing ambient, noise, experimental, and spoken-word into something both beautiful and unsettling. That vision culminated in the Isa LP, which was released earlier this year and features "real beauty and nightmarish imagery." 

But what about all the aspects that go into making music - getting it to the point of public consumption with little context for how it got there? What are the situations that go beyond the artists' names and hometowns? Who are these people who translate these otherworldly ideas into sounds and rhythms for us to enjoy? How much of what we hear can be attributed to the producer's own personality? What are they seeing and believing?

【 About the Embassy Residency 】

The Embassy Residency programme aims to investigate contemporary artists through in-house residencies by combining the respective sounds from two different electronic scenes. Embassy was founded as a branch of the cultural platform C-cube, which was founded during the Covid Pandemic of 2020, to support and empower Aarhus' music and cultural scene, as well as to create and foster artistic and musical networks.
