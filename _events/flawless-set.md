◈ We are thrilled to announce this special all-day event — a daytime festival & a club night — a celebration of art, community and underground music. Join us under the bridge for a vibrant day filled with great music and more!

◈ From local heroes to legends, from noon till dawn, we have a packed lineup that will keep you floating and bouncing all day and all night.

◈ We are honored to welcome a UK underground legend to Aarhus - Peverelist. The Livity Sound boss will no doubt be bringing an eclectic collection of cutting-edge club music that pushes the boundaries of the contemporary club music.

◈ In addition, we have the pleasure of hosting two killer DJs from down under, Temporal Cast head Kasun and Animalia boss Kia, who will be bringing the heat to little old Aarhus.

◈ Backing up this stellar offence we have an array of local heroes who will be behind the decks throughout the day - the talented Cirkeline, the mighty Perko, our very own Mødest and Turing B2B, and the super crew from Mejlegade 53 - DJ SRA, Jake, Mitro and a special live set by a local guest.. 👀

More details to be announced…

Mark your calendars and get ready for a day of pure bliss and sonik gold. 👾

Yours Truly,

FEUM
