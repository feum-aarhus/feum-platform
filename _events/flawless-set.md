<br>

This time, we wanted to delve a little further into the depth of the soundscape and Invite a very special guest. Join us for night full of deep house and deep techno.

<br>**【 E R I C_C L O U T I E R 】**<br> 

Cloutier’s twenty-plus year commitment has been built upon his integrity as a DJ and authority as a selector. A self-described "record digging psychopath," one only has to refer to his mix of highly sought after cuts from Driftwood Records to see the lengths Cloutier will go to in order to procure the perfect selection.

This is truly Cloutier’s nature - one of zeal and infatuation towards the warm, dubby, hypnotic house and techno that has come to characterize his sound as well as his masterful ability to bridge the gap between dance music’s past and its future. An exception to the norm, Cloutier is not one to capitalize on his Detroit origins. 

Moving to New York in his 20’s, he became a regular face at The Bunker where he began to further define his innate style of body orientated music. Now situated in Berlin, where he often shows up behind the decks of niche alcoves as well as the world’s best clubs, Cloutier’s reputation as an unequivocal, dexterous force is increasingly becoming one of note.

<br>

**【 MODEST】**<br>

Joining the line-up is a well known, still very humble, house and techno connoisseur Mødest. Host of FEUM events who always willing to warm-up the dance floor, any time of the night. This time bringing his uncharted, deep, and carefully selected record collection.

<br>

**【 PAWSI 】** <br>

Copenhagen-based, Aarhus bred, DJ and promoter rooted in Poland. Lifelong friend and contributor of FEUM. As a DJ, intuitively floating between deep and dark techno, soundscapes, and experimental electronic music. Pawsi’s sets are inspired by Swedish techno tradition, drone music, Scandinavian forests and wide-open spaces.

Don’t hesitate<br>
Yours Truly,<br>
FEUM <br>
