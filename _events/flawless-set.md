## 【 **F E U M  ／／  P H U T U R E**】[](https://coolsymbol.com/copy/Lower_Seven_Eighths_Block_Symbol_%E2%96%87)

We’re excited to bring you some of Copenhagen’s finest - an up and coming duo de force and a Copenhagen heavy weight. It’s sure to be one heck of a party.



【 **I N T E R F L O W** 】

Martin Gilleshøj & Anders Dahl have been making a name for themselves through their mixtape and radio series - Interflow. Regularly going b2b on their show and out around the Copenhagen electronic music scene. Expect an eclectic set of dance music defined by moods and flows, with elements of retro futuristic acid house and more.



【 **K A S P E R     M A R O T T** 】

The DJ and producer, Kasper Marott, has built up a reputation through various high-quality releases, such as his acclaimed debut album ‘Full Circle’ released on his label Axces Recordings and ‘Forever Mix EP’ released on ‘Kulør’, to name just a couple.

He’s also no stranger behind the decks. Playing parties from Berlin to Melbourne, where he developed an ear for solid grooves and free-flowing house sets, now moving across genres with exquisite taste and style, filled with the energy of the Copenhagen rave scene, as well as percussive oddball house cuts and more. No doubt to be a real treat to the ears, body and mind.



Don’t miss out on this one.

Yours Truly,

FEUM
