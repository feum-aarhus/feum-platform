  【 FEUM in CONCERT 】

◈ The first edition of a line of events in Turkis' dreamy lounge, focusing on electronic live music.

◈ Some sounds has been worked on for decades others are improvised in the moment.

◈ Some tunes are for dancing, others invite you to listen deeply.

The first line up is as follows: 

【 Rumpistol 】\[DK] (solo live-set) (Raske Plader/Iboga)

“Rum” is a Danish word for “space”, “room” or “reverb”.

For Danish composer Rumpistol, two huge driving forces behind his music are the search for beauty and the search for new sounds.

These sonic and aesthetic curiosities, which can be firmly traced back to his self-titled 2003 debut, now considered a bit of an IDM classic, have taken him to many diverse fields of the electronic as well as the more acoustic landscape. His releases as well as his live sets ranges from soft neo-classical piano pieces to spaced out bass-driven electronic music, often hard to categorise but always full of melody. Rumpistol has performed his detailed sound across the US, Europe, Mexico & Brazil including venues like Boom Festival, Tipper & Friends, Boiler Room UK and MUTEK Montreal.

【 Tp4 】\[DK] (leek records)

Tp4’s debut release Beneath the Surface on Leek Records! A warm shower of sincere emotions are displayed through the various styles Tp4 presents on this record. The record has nuances of electro, future jazz, breakbeat, house and the spaces in between. Carefully selected samples, synths and acoustic elements are interwoven to create the fabric that is Beneath the Surface. Let Tp4 take you on an earthbound trip through sonic spaces, with smooth rhythms riding on carpets of lush harmonies. Made under the influence of love, leek and beak.



【 Rasmus Fisker 】\[DK]

Rasmus Fisker is an experimental electronic artist from Aarhus.

Driven by musical intuition and scientific curiosity he composes electronic narratives for the ear.

Rasmus utilizes crooked beats and odd timbres from a broad pallet of sound sources from other dimensions, to create dreamlike soundscapes that surprise and soothe the listener.

LUNI will guide the night from his USB sticks, before, in between and after the concerts.  

Don’t hesitate.

Yours Truly,

FEUM
