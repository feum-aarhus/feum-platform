‚óà Spring is here and we‚Äôre back with another collab. We start a new season with new friendships and new connections üå±

‚óà This time we invite the crew behind KUNE Festival to help us make this special event and get us geared up for the approaching summer üåû

‚óà Behind the decks will be two of our resident DJs, alongside two from KUNE, spinning some fresh tunes to get you in bloom.

‚óà Join us at our beloved home venue, A-huset at Institut for (X), for a night filled with good vibes, great music, and even better company. Come down to connect with like-minded music lovers and celebrate the start of something special.

„Äê About KUNE Festival „Äë

Kune festival is a killer electronic music festival that celebrates the Scandinavian underground culture. It takes place on a 19th century island fort off the shoreline of Copenhagen. A unique celebration with five stages, two art galleries, and multiple art installations.

‚ÄúAn immersive experience that blends art, music, and the island‚Äôs natural beauty. The location‚Äôs secludedness adds to the sense of separation from everyday life. At the same time, the art invites us to engage in open discussions and imagine a world that can be different, making a positive impact over our mentality and worldview. In conjunction with the art, the music creates a holistic cultural experience representative of the modern, young Nordic artistic community.‚Äù

Something we a very much looking forward to this summer!

„Äê About FEUM Events „Äë

FEUM events are all about the intersection of electronic music, sensory experiences, and community connection. We believe in creating a space where the collective conscious shapes the overall atmosphere of the night, one that is full of energy and good times, one where everyone feels welcome, respected, and free to express themselves in their own way.

Our events are open to all no matter who you are, how you dress, or if it‚Äôs your first time at a techno party. We want to create an experience inclusive for everyone interested in the world of electronic music while supporting local DJs and creators.

We do our best to prevent people coming in who are heavily intoxicated or disrespectful so that not ruin the night but sometimes it‚Äôs hard, and we miss things. We encourage you to help make our events a fun and safe space for everyone by being mindful and responsible for your community.

If you see someone being disrespectful and not following our guidelines and house rules, then please help by calling them out where safe, or by informing a member of our crew or security. You can find us at the bar or at the door.

See you on the dance floor!

Yours Truly,

FEUM
