FEUM HANGOUT // REOPENING SOCIETY



We are eased to see that the Danish society is slowly but surely reopening. Yet, the lifting of restrictions does not allow us to hold a traditional night event as we all have been used to. It is encouraging, however, to think about a near future where we will finally celebrate life together again and dance to music minutely chosen by talented artists from other horizons! Exciting, right?



To make the burden of waiting slightly easier to carry, FEUM is delighted to present its first hangout since the lockdown. The event is considered as a sitting bar vibe hangout. Bar, electronic music, and people. Simple, cozy, and cheerful

A perfect recipe to gently reconnect with each other after a long-period of isolation.



An outdoor event with good music and friends. Entry is free but donations are welcome. FEUM kindly asks you to not bring your own alcohol and support the local culture by buying drinks at the bar.



The event will only be accessible for people having a corona passport (negative test in the last 72 hours, a vaccination, or recently recovered from Covid-19).



Be mindful regarding the current health situation: do not share cups, cigarettes, respect a decent social distance and disinfect your hands. Feeling sick? Stay home and recover properly
