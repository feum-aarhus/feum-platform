<br>This one is all about bass music. A night of body shaking, bone conducing, subsonik frequencies. It’s all about vibrations and deep oscillations, with appropriate sound pressures to release those tensions, get you floating and bouncing till the early morn.

We have a packed line-up with some of the finest bass music specialists around. Sure to be fully equipped with the most lethal bass tools in their bags - gigsta, Perko & N.E.GIRL will be in full force for this one.

Not only that but the scene will get some special aesthetic treatment with an otherworldly art installation by the one and only Phuc Van Dang.

Some tasty treats for the eyes, the ears, the body and the mind.

<br>**【 GIGSTA 】**<br> 

The Belgium-born, French-raised, Berlin-based multi-versed artist, DJ and academic gigsta returns to little old Aarhus for a proper sweaty bass-y rave at our beloved venue A-huset. Her reputation for playful, sometimes obscure sets has been spreading across Europe of late and the evidence is out there, with multitude of killer mixes on the net but also with her cosmic radio show Fictions on Cashmere Radio. Her DJ-sets range widely: from the very slow to the very fast, the old to the brand new, the silly to the ultra-serious and often incorporating her own collages but one thing we know for sure is that she has a collection of bass music that you just can’t resist to move to. 

<br>

**【 PERKO** **】**<br>

Our good friend Perko is back again, but this time he’s back in Aarhus for a round behind the decks in full club mode. \
The Copenhagen-based DJ and producer has been a on rising path with consistently solid music released on Copenhagen’s Posh Isolation and beloved Aarhus’ label Kerne of Safe Distribution, as well as international labels like Numbers. Like his productions, his DJ sets are next-level, playing elegantly across genres with the sounds that inspire his productions, full of bass and always fitting the space. We’ve been waiting some time to get Perko in the klub, and that time has finally come. We can’t wait for this one.

<br>

**【 N.E.GIRL 】** <br>

Making big waves in the DK scene, the Copenhagen-based, London-bred DJ and video artist, N.E.GIRL will be back in Aarhus once again  bringing her high-energy high-pressure selections to the klub this time for what’s sure to be a belter of a night, we simply can’t get enough. Known for championing the UK bass sound with a focus on deep and dark club music, her sets demonstrate a pure love for club music, sound system culture and the global underground - something that we share deeply.

This night is sure to be one to remember.

<br>

Don’t hesitate.<br>
Yours Truly,<br>
FEUM <br>
