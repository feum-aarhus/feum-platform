FEUM stands for freedom of expression and for quality electronic music. 

This late October we would like to take you on another journey presenting:

Norman Nodge (Ostgut Ton, DE) - There is no need to introduce Norman to anyone who follows the techno scene. Legendary DJ and producer of the German electronic music scene who put meaning and feeling in his robotic ecstatic nests of sounds. He will grace us with two - as intoxicatingly generous as you could possibly imagine - hours of his vision for techno.

Quoting “*Reclaim Your City”* - As a true master of the tempo and buildup, Norman sure knows when to ease off the accelerator and when to rev up the engines. Generous when the mind begs for a more spacious headspace to wander in, tightening the bolts with clockmaker precision when the room screams punishment. An absolute belter of a vinyl-only masterclass, from a faultless legend behind the decks.

BENTZON (EstaBunk, DK) - His love for challenging and non-conforming music he expressed not only by his long industrial DJ sets but also by his dedication to the legendary underground crew EstaBunk. While many secret location events Benzon proved that his shapes are only possible to define when experiencing theme.

TURING (FEUM, PL) - Aarhus Based DJ with Polish roots. Known also under the alias of det.al. Well-known FEUM resident since 2017. Turing's tracks reflect his evolution as a DJ over the last few years. The sound is still heavily influenced by house music, but it showcases a style of techno that isn't afraid to go a little more industrial. Heavy beats are peppered with snippets of eclectic samples ranging from grime vocals to drone sounds.
