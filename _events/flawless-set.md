◈ Fully charged up from a spectacular summer, we are back with another hot treat to round the season off in good fashion.

◈ This time we present the hypnotizing Australian duo OK EG (live!). Followed up by a special talent straight out of the Polish underground, Zenwerk. And on duty heating up the dancefloor will be the one and only Modest.

◈ Join us at our beloved home venue, A-huset at Institut for (X), for one trippy summer night.

【 About OK EG 】

<!--StartFragment-->

Composed of producers Matthew Wilson and Lauren Squire, OK EG’s strident sound melds rhythm, bass and analogue synth. Known for their hardware-based live sets, the pair spiral around unpredictable patterns and interlocking grooves, encapsulating the unhinged energy of the Melbourne underground; think liquid dnb, slow-build trance and fractural percussion. Joining the wave of talent rising out of Australia for their debut EU tour, OK EG bring their deep and expansive sound to FEUM on August 18th.

【 About Zenwerk 】

Zenwerk is the Belarusian artist now based in Warsaw, Poland, is the creative force behind the multidisciplinary art collective and label, Synergy Cult. As a music producer, DJ, live performer, and sound designer, zenwzerk's innovative approach plunges into modern and experimental neo-house and breakbeat sound textures. His DJ mixes, much like his music, dive into experimentation, melding genres and sounds, inviting the listener to perceive music in a new light.
