// PERKO\
// RASMUS FISKER

support from FEUM resident DJs // PAN BONKA and DET.AL



\*\* Schacke - “Martin Schacke pioneered in the Copenhagen industrial and noise scene via countless releases under various pseudonyms on his label Moral Defeat.

After a series of powerful releases on labels like Ectotherm, Kulør, Instruments of Discipline, Intrepid Skin, his distinctive style has made him a central figure in the relentless and often transgressive community of club experimentation. His music is expanding boundaries, while still maintaining absolute club pressure, with sets that are agile, noisy and trancy.”

\*\* Perko - “Originally born in Scotland, has long been a household name within the electronic music scene of Copenhagen, having released records on Posh Isolation and Safe, as well as international labels like Numbers. Perko’s style is unique and spans from modern club cuts, fusing a wide range of genres, to ambient soundscapes, often integrating field recordings from Copenhagen and other surroundings.”

\*\* Rasmus Fisker - “Captivated with shape shifting sounds wherein textures matter as much as melodies, and voices are littered with crypticism. His music cherry-picks and transforms elements from genres as diverse as electronica, drone and deep techno sounds. The result is a web of sound that threads poetic lyricism and unfamiliar instruments over a backdrop of electronic elements and synth-heavy dance beats.”
