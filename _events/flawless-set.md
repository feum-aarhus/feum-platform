FEUM Live is back again and this time we are over the moon to present live performances from the mystical Cucina Povera and mythical Civilistjävel! at our local super venue, Super, for a night of deep and hypnotic electronic harmonies and abstractions. Not only that but we have the talented Perko returning to Aarhus to play out the night with a post-concert warm-down and Saturday night warm-up DJ set.

<br>

**【 CUCINA POVERA 】- LIVE** <br>

Glasgow-based Finnish Karelia-born sound artist, Maria Rossi, has been on a roll the past few years with a string of sublime releases on Night School, such as the gorgeous ‘Hilja’, as well as releases on Primordial Void and Offen Music. 

Her music takes audiences through realms of deep enchantment with a signature ethereal and hypnotic sound created through explorations of multi-layered voice, field recordings and synthesis. You’ll be sure to ascend to a higher plane with this one.

<br>

**【 CIVILISTJAVEL! 】- LIVE** <br>

Emerging from the depths of some Scandinavian forest.. and celebrating the release of their new record ‘Järnnätter’ on Perko’s new label FELT! The Swedish enigma that is Civilistjävel! comes to Aarhus. 

Previously only known in the ’90s Scandinavian underground through private tape/CDR-trading networks, the Civilistjävel! project has seen a line of intimate releases via London’s Low Company, varying from exquisite sunken dubbed out minimal techno to industrial ambient electronic noise meditations. 

Civilistjävel!’s live minimal synth sound architectures conjure up deep forest secrets taking audiences into ethereal and boreal atmospheres but then again Civilistjävel! live is always a surprise. 

<br>

**【 PERKO 】- DJ SET** <br>

The Copenhagen-based DJ and Producer has been a on rising path with consistently solid music released on Copenhagen’s Posh Isolation and beloved Aarhus’ label Kerne of Safe Distribution, as well as international labels like Numbers.

With such slick skills in production, he is unsurprisingly as good behind the decks, playing across genres with the sounds that inspire his productions, and always fitting the space.

He has also recently launched a promising new label called FELT, aiming to release records that are “timeless, minimal, and rooted in sound system culture,”.

So he comes to Aarhus to celebrate and play out the night with music that is sure to be fit for purpose. We can’t wait to celebrate with him.
